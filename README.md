LeetCode C++ Solutions

Things to consider while you are coding.

* Time Complexity & Space Complexity 
  
  Try to calculate both of them, after you solve any problem.
  
* Try to do the same problem in different ways  

    Try to optimize the problem 
      
      We can do this in 2 terms - 
        
        1. Time Optimization -- try to reduce the time complexity
        2. Space Optimization -- try to reduce/remove the space usage
